### me and 'puter

{{< figure src="/images/2025-12-27-comic-code/new-macos-sc.jpg" caption="the font is [Comic Code](./blog/2025-12-27-comic-code.md)"  >}}

My machines:

- M1 MacBook Air: runs the latest macOS
- [Framework Laptop 13](/blog/2025-11-06-framework.md): runs the latest Fedora KDE Spin
- ThinkPad X270: retired for now
- UGreen DXP2800: my NAS

I spend a lot of time in my terminal emulator and [(Neo)](/tags/neovim) [vim](/tags/vim).

I cannot function without a tiling window manager; on macOS, I use [Aerospace](/blog/2025-04-05-aerospace.md), and on Linux, Sway or KDE with Krohnkite script.

You can find all other tools and config files in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/theopn/dotfiles).

### k. what else do you like?
