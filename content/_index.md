### me and 'puter

{{< figure src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theopn/haunted-tiles/refs/heads/main/assets/sway-sc.png" caption="my Framework 13 running Fedora with SwayFX"  >}}

My machines:

(yeah, I quickly ran out of \*saber names and switched to the philosopher names).

I spend a lot of time in my terminal emulator and [(Neo)](/tags/neovim) [vim](/tags/vim).

I cannot function without a tiling window manager; on macOS, I use [Aerospace](/blog/2025-04-05-aerospace.md), and on Linux, Sway or KDE with Krohnkite script.

You can find all other tools and config files in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/theopn/dotfiles).
