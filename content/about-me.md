## Academics

[*My Résumé ⧉* ... which has not been uploaded yet](/images/todo.pdf)

I am an undergraduate student at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), majoring in computer science and philosophy.

- Academic Interests (CS): CS theories, machine learning, CS education, <insert whatever the topics I am learning at the moment>
- Academic Interests (Philosophy): Philosophy of science, logic, set theory, metaphysics

I am a member of [Undergraduate Student Board](https://purdueusb.com/) (USB) for the CS department.

## Research & Teaching

Throughout the 2022 - 2023 school year, I worked as an instructor for CS19300: Tools.
CS193 is an awesome class managed by the [CS193 initiative in USB](https://purdueusb.com/initiatives/).
I delivered weekly lectures on fundamental development tools, including Git, Unix shell commands, and Vim, to first-year CS, DS, and AI students.
I managed 437 students across three sections, and it was a great experience communicating with freshmen and being in charge of a large technical course.

In 2022, I worked as a course content developer for CS18200: Foundations of Computer Science.
I was in charge of designing a new homework template using LaTeX.
I also developed and tested assignment questions for first-order logic, discrete probabilities, and runtime analysis.

I worked as a course content developer for CS180 during the summer of my freshman year.
Using JUnit, I designed and developed coding assignments and auto-graders for exception handling and file I/O.

During the portion of my freshman and sophomore years, I worked as an undergraduate teaching assistant for CS18000: Problem Solving and Objected-Oriented Programming.
I helped students with topics ranging from fundamental programming skills to Java network I/O and GUI.
I was recognized for achieving the third-highest reputation score on Campuswire (student Q&A forum) in course history.

## Me and Computer

I enjoy using Linux and exploring the nooks and crannies of the operating system.
Operating systems have always fascinated me, even from a young age.
When I was in middle school, my biggest hobby was collecting ISO images of old operating systems (shout out to [WinWorld](https://winworldpc.com/)) and installing them in virtual machines.
I use Fedora, btw.

Did you just ask what DE/WM I use in Fedora? Thank you for asking!
I love tiling window managers and have spent lots of time making them look pretty.

- On Linux, I have tried i3, Sway, AwesomeWM, Hyprland, and I found myself keep returning to i3/Sway for its simplicity
- On macOS, I have tried Amethyst, Yabai + Skhd + Sketchybar, and Aerospace, and Aerospace suited my workflow the best; perhaps not surprising since it is heavily inspired by i3

> Q: Does spending more time finding the perfect gap margins between windows make me more productive?

> A: ... No. But it sure is exciting!

I am a big fan of (neo)vim.
Neovim is my IDE, text editor, file manager, and journal.
As all Vimmers do, I have spent and will spend countless hours configuring Neovim.

I also enjoy configuring other open-source CLI utilities.
You can find all my config files in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/theopn/dotfiles).

Because I moved frequently during my teenage and 20s, I have never built or owned a PC.
Instead, I developed an interest in watching YouTube reviews for smartphones, laptops, and other mobile devices.
[Snazzy Labs](https://www.youtube.com/@snazzy) and [MrMobile](https://www.youtube.com/@TheMrMobile) are my favorite YouTubers in this field.
