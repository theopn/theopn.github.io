Noah Kahan released a remix of Call Your Mom with Lizzy McAlpine today.
I have been following Noah since Hurt Somebody, his first EP, from 2018, and I even went to his concert earlier this year when he came to Purdue.
I also have listened to some of Lizzy's songs (Ceilings, All My Ghosts, and a fantastic [cover of Stayin' Alive she did with Scary Pockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piTvLuHWLyg)).
The song is fantastic as expected, and Lizzy's voice adds much depth to already-great-song.
I should listen to more of Lizzy because damn, her voice is something.

Today I learned that Debian was first released on September 15.
Debian was *announced* by Ian Murdock on the Linux Usenet on August 16, 1993, and 0.01, the first internal release, was out on September 15, 1993.
Yes, Debian is exactly 9 years older than me.
I knew that Ian Murdock was a Purdue CS alumni, but damn, maybe it's the sign for me to switch to Debian.

Watch [Brodie Robertson's YouTube video on Debian history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szZ7_Sxy7xQ) for more background.

I found a ladybug on my window frame.
It made me happy.
